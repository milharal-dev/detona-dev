# For Developers

## Understand the project structure

The project is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a React application that uses the Vite framework for development, leveraging TypeScript for type checking and ESLint/Prettier for linting and formatting. The backend is a Node.js application that uses Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.

## Frontend

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
- NPM (version 9.x or higher)
- yarn (version 1.22.x or higher)

### Figma Design

The Figma design file can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/tTo5rY1UL1HbyVBqXYXEz1).

### Important Information

We use the following technologies for the frontend:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- react-router-dom

Please avoid adding unnecessary dependencies to the frontend. We want to keep the project as lightweight as possible.
