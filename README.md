# For Developers 🛠️

## Understand the project structure 📚

The project is divided into two parts: the Frontend and the Backend. The Frontend is a React application that uses the Vite framework for development, leveraging TypeScript for type checking and ESLint/Prettier for linting and formatting. The Backend is a Node.js application that uses Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.

## Frontend 🖥️

### Prerequisites 📦

- Node.js (version 18.x or higher)
- NPM (version 9.x or higher)
- yarn (version 1.22.x or higher)

### Important Information 📝

We use the following technologies for the Frontend:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
